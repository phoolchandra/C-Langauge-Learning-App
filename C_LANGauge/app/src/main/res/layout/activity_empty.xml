            android:text="C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.\n\n

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the KR standard.\n\n

The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons −\n\n

1 Easy to learn\n
2 Structured language\n
3 It produces efficient programs\n
4 It can handle low-level activities\n
5 It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms\n\n\n
Facts about C:-\n\n\n
1 C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.\n
2 C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.\n
3 The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).\n
4 The UNIX OS was totally written in C.\n
5 Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.\n
6 Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.\n
7 Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.\n\n\n
Why use C?\n\n\n
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be −\n\n\n

1 Operating Systems\n
2 Language Compilers\n
3 Assemblers\n
4 (Text Editors);\n
5 'Print Spoolers'\n
6 Network Drivers\n
7 Modern Programs\n
8 Databases\n
9 Language Interpreters\n
10 Utilities\n\n"
